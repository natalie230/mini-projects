### Key Insights

## My Approach
When designing this dashboard, I asked:
- What would a manager care about most? (cancellation rate, reasons, peak times, locations
- How to present the storytelling for quick decisions? (KPIs at the top, filters for drill-down, heatmap for locations)
- What level of detail is appropriate?

Graphs to show:
- Distribution of cancellation by (cancelled by, is driver assigned) -> hints cancellation reasons
- Distribution of locations where cancellation happen -> shows popular location for cancellation
- Distribution of cancellation by hour category -> shows peak times
